# Endless Match Three

We had a desire to try something new, free time in the evenings and Telegramm documentation.

The project is a Back-End of the game “Endless Match Three”, realized on the basis of Telegramm mini-apps.  
The resulting project is nothing more than MVP, many decisions were made in favor of fast development, many places are not polished at all, but that's life.

P.S. All secrets in configs have been revoked, so you don't have to try.
